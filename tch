Piano Trio in A minor, Op. 50 (1882)

The piece is marked by a tragic perspective and is in two movements:
I. Pezzo elegiaco (Moderato assai – Allegro giusto) (in A minor) (approx 20:00)
II. (A) Tema con variazioni: Andante con moto (in E major) – (B) Variazione finale e coda (in A major – A minor) (approx 27:00)

It is subtitled In memory of a great artist, in reference to Nikolai Rubinstein, his close friend and mentor, 
who had died on 23 March 1881. It is scored for piano, violin, and cello.

2- Andante cantabile (B♭ major)
第二节尤其动人

Op. 20 Swan Lake, ballet (1876)

#
Op. 23 Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor (1875)

我并不认为这是一个很好听的曲子

Symphonies No. 5 in E minor, Op. 64 (1888)
命运，和第四交响曲的主题类似。
